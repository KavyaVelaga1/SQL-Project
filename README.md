The data used for this project pertains to company layoffs. 
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing datasets related to these layoffs. The dataset contains columns such as company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, and funds_raised_millions. By removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and handling null values, we aim to ensure high-quality data for subsequent analysis and reporting. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) has been performed to uncover insights and trends within the data.
